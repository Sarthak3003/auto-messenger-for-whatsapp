surely you want to sleep, who doesn't. Run this and sleep. only for those people who can't stay up late to wish someone on their birthday. Avoid being rude

It's very simple, first of all install chrome-web-driver and ADD TO PATH, PLEASE. thank you
now install selenium

for those who don't know how to, open cmd and copy-paste
```python
pip install selenium
```
ALSO, if you still get error for, css somthing something element not found, then change the class name with the class name of your window. Now how to do that, when you run the script, it will open a web-browser (chrome), login in by scanning the code, trust me, it's not hacking your whatsapp, no one wants to see that. Then open anyy chat and open dev-tools, click the arrow thing there and select the "message box" and copy paste the class name in line 18, then do the same for send button and replace the class name in line 36, the re-run the code. It should work
Else delete the code and stay up will 12 to wish people.
